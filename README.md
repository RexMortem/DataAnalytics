# DataAnalytics
A tool for several data analytics methods

## Personal To-Do:

- Make the functions pure
- Different output forms (outputting directly to LaTeX would be ideal)
- Creating Outputs folder
- Python Venv
- brief writeup of each method
- could move from strings to enums for types in OutputManager
