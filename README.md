# DataAnalytics
A tool mainly for doing Lagrange and APCA.

Refer to **main.py** for an example usage!

## Personal To-Do:

- Make the functions pure
- Different output forms (outputting directly to LaTeX would be ideal)
- Creating Outputs folder
- Python Venv
- brief writeup of each method
- could move from strings to enums for types in OutputManager
